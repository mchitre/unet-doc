== Routing in larger networks

=== MISSION 2013 network

The MISSION 2013 experiment in Singapore featured a 7-node network that was deployed at sea (see <<fig_m13_map>>) for several weeks. The network operated in a challenging area with complex 3D bathymetry, several reefs and heavy shipping. During the experiment, we transmitted more than 40000 frames of data and collected statistics on communication performance across various links in the network. These performance statistics are embedded in the `Mission2013a` channel model in UnetStack. We use a simulated version of the MISSION 2013 network to learn how to set up and operate larger networks that require routing.

To start the simulated network, we simply run the `mission2013-network.groovy` simulation script:

While the MISSION 2013 network is not physically very large (only about 1.5 km across), the challenging environment kept the network from being fully connected, i.e., not all nodes could directly communicate with all others. The average frame delivery ratio (number of successfully delivered frames / number of transmitted frames) on each link is shown in <<tab_m13_fdr>>. The link quality is also shown on the map in <<fig_m13_map>>, with dark blue links being the good ones, dark green ones being the weak ones, and brownish one being the very poor link.

=== Connectivity without routing

During the MISSION 2013 experiment, node 21 was a gateway node with surface expression and connectivity to the Internet (via a 3G cellular network). All other nodes were on the seabed and not directly accessible. So let us start by exploring the connectivity from node 21 to other nodes:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> ping 22
PING 22
Response from 22: seq=0 rthops=2 time=2892 ms
Response from 22: seq=1 rthops=2 time=2912 ms

Response from 29: seq=1 rthops=2 time=18720 ms

3 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 33% packet loss
> ping 31

> ping 34

Response from 34: seq=1 rthops=2 time=3294 ms
Response from 34: seq=2 rthops=2 time=3434 ms
3 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 33% packet loss
----

We see that the connectivity to nodes 22 and 28 is good, that to nodes 27, 29 and 34 is poorer, and to node 31 is non-existent. Since the simulation is probabilistic, your exact results may differ.

=== Static routing

From <<fig_m13_map>> and <<tab_m13_fdr>>, we see that node 28 has good connectivity to nodes 31 and 34, so perhaps we could relay datagrams via node 28. Although the link between 22 and 27 seems to be better than the rest, the connectivity to that node is generally poor. Let us set up the following routes:

- Relay data between nodes 21 and 31 via node 28
- Relay data between nodes 21 and 34 via node 28

On node 21, we add routes to nodes 31 and 34:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> addroute 31, 28
OK
> addroute 34, 28
OK
> routes
    uuid      to nextHop         link reliability hops metric enabled
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  riddcc      31      28       uwlink        true    0    0.0    true
  fkxbqm      34      28       uwlink        true    0    0.0    true
----

On nodes 31 and 34, we add routes to node 21 via node 28, and enable remote access:

.`Node 31`
[source]
----
> addroute 21, 28
OK
> routes
    uuid      to nextHop         link reliability hops metric enabled
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  b7m7w9      21      28       uwlink        true    0    0.0    true
> remote.enable = true
true
----

.`Node 34`
[source]
----
> addroute 21, 28
OK
> routes
    uuid      to nextHop         link reliability hops metric enabled
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  s6pjtb      21      28       uwlink        true    0    0.0    true
> remote.enable = true
true
----

Now, we can check out connectivity from node 21 to nodes 31 and 34 again:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> ping 31
PING 31
Response from 31: seq=0 rthops=4 time=18930 ms
Response from 31: seq=1 rthops=4 time=10680 ms
Response from 31: seq=2 rthops=4 time=46139 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
> ping 34
PING 34
Response from 34: seq=0 rthops=4 time=26760 ms
Response from 34: seq=1 rthops=4 time=34408 ms
Response from 34: seq=2 rthops=4 time=21660 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
----

Much better!

The pings to nodes 31 and 34 show `rthops` (round trip hops) to be 4, which makes sense, since we have 2-hop routes in each direction. We can ask the routing agent for a trace to check what route the datagram took:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> trace 31
[21, 28, 31, 28, 21]
----

This shows that the datagram originated at node 21, passed through node 28 before reaching node 31. Then on the way back, it passed through node 28 again, and reached us back at node 21.

Let us next try to do something using the routes we created. We can get node 21 to ask node 31 to measure the range to node 34 and report it to us. This request will be relayed via node 28, since our routing tables are set up to do so. Remember to set `remote.enable = true` on node 31 before making the request from node 21:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> rsh 31, '?range 34'
AGREE
[31]: 873.67
----

As you can see from <<tab_m13_fdr>>, the connectivity between nodes 31 and 34 is poor in this simulated network. You may need to try this command several times before you get a range estimate. When the ranging fails, you should see the message "ERROR: No response from remote node" back from node 31, which by itself demonstrates successful routing.

TIP: If you don't have the patience to try a few times for range from node 31 to node 34, try getting a range from node 31 to 28, which will be much quicker: `rsh 31, '?range 28'`.

=== Route discovery

In the previous section, we learned how to set up static routes manually. But what if we are too lazy to determine the routes manually? Or if we don't have access to the nodes on the seabed to set up routes? We can use the route discovery agent to populate the routing tables.

To see how to do this, let us restart our MISSION 2013 simulation so that the routing tables are empty (alternatively we can remove the routes we created earlier by typing `delroutes` on nodes 21, 31 and 34). We can verify that the routing table is indeed empty:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> routes
No routes available
----

Now, start a route discovery to node 31:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> rreq 31
OK
----

Patiently wait for a minute or two before checking the routing table on node 21:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> routes
    uuid      to nextHop         link reliability hops metric enabled
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  69gnxp      22      22       uwlink        true    1    0.0    true
  ib3goj      28      28       uwlink        true    1    0.0    true
  68ozs5      29      29       uwlink        true    1    0.0    true
  gkfin2      31      29       uwlink        true    2   -1.0    true
----

Your routing table may differ, as the route discovery process is probabilistic. We see that we now have a route to node 31 via node 29. Let us check the routing table on node 31 as well, to see if it has a corresponding entry for a route to node 21:

.`Node 31`
[source]
----
> routes
    uuid      to nextHop         link reliability hops metric enabled
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  1hveg6      28      28       uwlink        true    1    0.0    true
  pjfhin      21      28       uwlink        true    3   -1.0    true
  n5eqll      34      34       uwlink        true    1    0.0    true
  8jlzj3      21      34       uwlink        true    3   -2.0    true
   f6dit      29      29       uwlink        true    1    0.0    true
  qqtwvd      21      29       uwlink        true    3   -2.0    true
----

Indeed it does! In fact, it has 3 routes back to node 21, one via node 29, and two more via nodes 28 and 34. Of these routes, the route via node 28 has the largest metric, and so will be the route that is used. We can verify that by issuing a trace from node 21:

.`Node 21`
[source]
----
> trace 31
[21, 29, 31, 28, 21]
----

TIP: Since the route discovery process is probabilistic, it may be useful to repeat the route discovery if good routes are not established after a single try. The `rreq` command can also be called with parameters to control the repetition. For example `rreq 31, 3, 6, 30` will initiate 6 route discoveries to node 31 looking for up to 3-hop routes spaced by 30 seconds between discoveries.
