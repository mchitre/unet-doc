== State persistence

`*org.arl.unet.Services.STATE_MANAGER*`

=== Overview

An agent offering the STATE_MANAGER service provides a way to save the state (parameter values) of specified (or all) agents.

Such an agent typically subscribes to the {url-unet-javadoc}org/arl/unet/Topics.html#PARAMCHANGE[`PARAMCHANGE`^] topic and monitor `ParamChangeNtf` for all parameter changes for all agents. It then helps persist selected agents' parameter values between reboots.

==== Messages

STATE_MANAGER service providers honor the following messages:

* {url-unet-javadoc}org/arl/unet/state/SaveStateReq.html[`SaveStateReq`^] => `AGREE` / `REFUSE` / `FAILURE` -- save agent state to a file
* {url-unet-javadoc}org/arl/unet/state/ClearStateReq.html[`ClearStateReq`^] => `AGREE` / `REFUSE` / `FAILURE` -- clear agent state in memory, and track only parameter changes henceforth

The `SaveStateReq` message causes the agent state (changed parameters) to be persisted to a Groovy script file in the `scripts` folder. The default name of the file is `saved-state.groovy`, and this file is automatically loaded on startup. However, the `SaveStateReq` message can specify an alternate filename to persist the state in. In such cases, the file is run manually when the state is to be restored.

=== Examples

Fire up Unet audio (`bin/unet audio`) to test out how state persistence works:

[source]
----
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[4].powerLevel = -42.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -42.0
> plvl -40
OK
> shutdown
----

Now start Unet audio again, and you'll find that the `plvl` state was not retained through reboots:

[source]
----
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[4].powerLevel = -42.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -42.0
----

We can ask it to retain the state:

[source]
----
> plvl -40
OK
> savestate                       //<1>
AGREE
> ls
README.md [759 bytes]
saved-state.groovy [156 bytes]    //<2>
> shutdown
----
<1> The `savestate` command just sends a `SaveStateReq` message to the STATE_MANAGER service provider.
<2> The `saved-state.groovy` file is created with all the parameter changes to all agents.

Start Unet audio again, and you'll find that the state is retained:

[source]
----
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[4].powerLevel = -40.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -40.0
> shutdown
----

The `saved-state.groovy` is human-readable, and you'll see that it simply contains the Groovy code to set the parameters required to restore the state:

.saved-state.groovy:
[source, groovy]
----
def phy = agent('phy')
phy[1].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[4].powerLevel = -40.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -40.0
----

Delete this file and start Unet audio again:

[source]
----
> help savestate
savestate - save state of all or specified agent in Groovy script format

Examples:
  savestate 'pandan'          // save current state of all agents
  savestate 'pandan', 'phy'   // save current state of specified agent
  savestate 'pandan', phy     // save current state of specified agent
  savestate                   // save current state in "saved-state.groovy"

> help clrstate
clrstate - set current state as the baseline for savestate

Example:
  clrstate                    // set baseline state
  phy[1].powerLevel = -10     // change parameters
  savestate                   // save changed parameters
----

The help shows you that the `savestate` command can be used to save the state of individual agents, if you wish, to a filename of your choice. If you save the state to a different filename, it is not automatically restored on startup. But you can restore it easily with a single command (name of the file):

[source]
----
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -42.0
phy[4].powerLevel = -42.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -42.0
> plvl -40
OK
> savestate 'p40', phy            //<1>
AGREE
> plvl -10                        //<2>
OK
> ls
README.md [759 bytes]
p40.groovy [156 bytes]            //<3>
> p40                             //<4>
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -40.0
phy[4].powerLevel = -40.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -40.0
----
<1> Save the `plvl -40` state to a file called `p40.groovy`.
<2> Change the state.
<3> The state is saved in the `p40.groovy` file in the `scripts` folder.
<4> Command `p40` runs the `p40.groovy` file to restore the state to `plvl -40`.

.Startup scripts
****
While the STATE_MANAGER service provides a convenient way to save the current state, sometimes you may wish to write a customized startup script that sets up the node the way you wish. This can be achieved via the `setup.groovy`, `startup.groovy` and `fshrc.groovy` scripts in the `scripts` folder.

If you create a `setup.groovy` script, the default stack is disabled, allowing you to customize the agents that are loaded. The only agents that are automatically loaded if this script is present are the NODE_INFO, PHYSICAL and SHELL agents. The `setup.groovy` script is called during the setup phase of bootup, when agents are being loaded. It is the responsibility of the `setup.groovy` script to setup the rest of the stack by loading appropriate agents.

If you create a `startup.groovy` script, it is called after all agents are loaded and the stack is fully initialized. You may put Groovy commands in this script to customize your agent parameters and other settings. The `startup.groovy` script is called before the `saved-state.groovy` script, if one exists.

If you create a `fshrc.groovy` script, it is executed by each Groovy shell agent, when it is loaded. This allows customization of commands and variables available in the shell for user interaction.
