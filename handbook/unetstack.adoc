== UnetStack basics

UnetStack is an _agent-based network stack_. Each _agent_ is similar to a _layer_ in a traditional network stack, but has more flexibility to use the scarce resources (bandwidth, energy, etc) in the Unet more efficiently. In order to develop Unet applications, we need to understand some basic concepts in UnetStack.

=== The command shell

The simplest way to interact with UnetStack is via the command shell (or simply _shell_). The shell may be accessed on the console, a TCP/IP port or via the web interface. In <<Getting started>>, we have already seen how to set up a 2-node network and access the command shell for each of the nodes using a web browser. For the rest of this section, we assume that you have shells open on nodes A and B.

On node A, we can ask for a list of agents running:

[source]

----

We can further ask for more details of a specific agent:

----

We asked for details of the agent `phy`, and we got a list of parameters supported by the agent. We can get or set individual parameters of the agent:

[source]
----
> phy.MTU
56
> phy.rxEnable
true
> phy.rxEnable = false
false
> phy.rxEnable
false
> phy.rxEnable = true
true
----

To find out more about a specific parameter, we can ask for help on the parameter:

[source]
----
> help phy.MTU
phy.MTU - maximum transmission unit (MTU) in bytes
> help phy.rxEnable
phy.rxEnable - true if reception enabled
----

We can also ask for help on an agent:

[source]
----

  phy                           // access physical parameters

  phy[DATA]                     // access data channel parameters
  phy << msg                    // send request msg to physical agent
  phy.rxEnable = false          // disable reception of frames

From this help, we see that `phy` agent also supports channel parameters (also known as _indexed_ parameters). It supports two logical channels, CONTROL (1) and DATA (2). The CONTROL channel is meant for low-rate robust data transmission, whereas the DATA channel is typically configured for higher rate data transmission. Channel parameters work in the same way as normal parameters, but with an index:

NOTE: The actual parameters you see may differ if you are working with a modem, depending on the specific capabilities of the modem. Use `help` to find out more about any listed parameter on your modem, or refer to the modem's documentation for further information.

Most agents also support some commands. For example, the `phy` agent supports the `plvl` command:

[source]
----
> help plvl
plvl - get/set TX power level for all PHY channel types

Examples:
  plvl                       // get all power levels
  plvl -10                   // set all power to -10 dB
  plvl(-10)                  // alternative syntax
  plvl = -10                 // alternative syntax

> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -10.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -10.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -10.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -10.0
> plvl -20
OK
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -20.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -20.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -20.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -20.0
----

The `plvl` command simply displays or sets the `powerLevel` parameter of all channels. The same can be manually accomplished by setting or getting individual parameters, if desired:

[source]
----
> phy[1].powerLevel
-20
> phy[1].powerLevel = -10
-10
> phy[1].powerLevel
-10
> plvl
phy[1].powerLevel = -10.0
phy[2].powerLevel = -20.0
phy[3].powerLevel = -20.0
phy.signalPowerLevel = -20.0
----

TIP: While `plvl` seems like a command to just set/get a `powerLevel` parameter, it does that for several channels in one go. This can save you a lot of time and typing -- to achieve the same thing manually, you'd be typing 4 commands!

=== Interacting with agents using messages

While you can access a lot of functionality via parameters and commands, to fully harness the power of UnetStack, we require an understanding of the underlying messaging system between the agents. All agents support messages that expose their functionality. In fact, all parameters and commands are implemented by exchanging messages between the shell agent and other agents. In this section, we'll take a brief look at how messaging between agents works.

TIP: All parameters and commands are implemented by exchanging messages between the shell agent and other agents. When you get/set a parameter, all the shell is doing is sending a `ParameterReq` message to the appropriate agent, and showing you the `ParameterRsp` message that the agent responds with.

Typically, we would want to send a _request_ to an agent and get a _response_ message back. This can be accomplished with the `request` call (or the equivalent alias `<<`) on the agent:

[source]
----
> phy << new TxFrameReq(data: [1,2,3])
AGREE
phy >> TxFrameNtf:INFORM[type:CONTROL txTime:2913909740]
----

Here we made a request to the `phy` agent to transmit some data. The agent responded with an `AGREE` response, shortly followed by a `TxFrameNtf` notification from `phy` telling us that the transmission was successful.

TIP: A _frame_ is simply a datagram at the physical layer, also sometimes called a "packet". We prefer the term "frame" when working at the physical layer, but the distinction between frames and datagrams is unimportant at this point in time. We will come back to this later, in <<Physical service>>.

We can also use the return value in a condition, but we need to remember that the return value from the `request` is a message:

[source]
----
> x = phy << new TxFrameReq();
phy >> TxFrameNtf:INFORM[type:CONTROL txTime:3381446740]
> x
AGREE
> x.class
class org.arl.fjage.Message
> x.performative
AGREE
> if (x.performative == Performative.AGREE) print 'OK'
OK
----

TIP: The semicolon ";" at the end of the first statement prevents the return value from being printed on the shell.

Unsolicited notification messages can be received by subscribing to the topic of interest. For example, on node B, we can subscribe to physical layer events on node B:

[source]
----
> subscribe phy
----

Now, if we broadcast a frame from node A using `phy << new TxFrameReq()`, we will see the relevant reception events on node B:

[source]
----
phy >> RxFrameStartNtf:INFORM[type:CONTROL rxTime:1765508396]
phy >> RxFrameNtf:INFORM[type:CONTROL from:232 rxTime:1765508396]
----

The first event `RxFrameStartNtf` is triggered as soon as the frame is detected at node B. The second event `RxFrameNtf` is triggered when the frame is fully received, demodulated and successfully decoded at the receiver.

If all of this seems somewhat confusing to you, don't worry about it. Most of the basic functionality of the stack can be accessed without having to deal with messages directly. As we need functionality that requires an understanding of messaging, we'll gradually introduce them in later chapters.

=== Shell scripting

The default UnetStack shell accepts any {url-groovy}[Groovy] code, and so is very flexible:

[source]
----
> 1+2
3
> 5.times { print it }
0
1
2
3
4
----

You can also define closures (if you're not familiar with closures, you can think of them as functions for now):

[source]
----
> tx2 = {
-   2.times {
-     phy << new TxFrameReq()
-   }
- };
----

and call them later:

[source]
----
> tx2
phy >> TxFrameNtf:INFORM[type:CONTROL txTime:3911898740]
phy >> TxFrameNtf:INFORM[type:CONTROL txTime:3912307740]
----

TIP: You can write Groovy scripts and store them in the `scripts` folder with an extension `.groovy`. You can then invoke them from the shell by simply typing the name of the script (without the extension).

This only scratches the surface of what the command shell is capable of. However, it should provide you a basic understanding of how the shell works, and illustrate its power. To understand more, we suggest that you explore the online `help`. As you further understand the UnetStack and fjåge API, you'll develop expertise on using the shell.
